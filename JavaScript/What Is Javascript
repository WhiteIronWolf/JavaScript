What is JavaScript

Javascript is a lightweight, cross-platform, object-oriented programming language...

  lightweight: the language doesn't eat up very much of the memory.

  cross-platform: means the language can be used on multiple platforms and systems. Not just for web development.

  object-oriented: means that it's a language that's based on objects.

JavaScript is what made modern web development possible:

  Dynamics effects and interactivity

  Modern Web applications that we can interact with.

The three languages works perfectly together:

  html: responsible for the content on the page
    text
    images
    buttons

  css
    presentation
    styling
    layout

  JavaScript
    Dynamics
    Interaction
    Manipulation

Different JavaScript versions:
