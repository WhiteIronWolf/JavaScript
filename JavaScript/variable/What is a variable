What is a variable:

A variable is like a container in which we can store a value in order to use it over and over again.
In short it's a container for storing data values.

differences between var, let and const:

1  var declarations are globally scoped or function scoped while let and const are block scoped.

2  var variables can be updated and re-declared within its scope; let variables can be updated
   but not re-declared; const variables can neither be updated nor re-declared.

3  They are all hoisted to the top of their scope but while varvariables are initialized with undefined,
   let and const variables are not initialized.

4  While var and let can be declared without being initialized, const must be initialized during declaration.
