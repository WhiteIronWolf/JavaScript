# What is a variable:

A variable is like a container in which we can store a value in order to use it over and over again.
In short it's a container for storing data values.


### **javascript variabel**
```javascript
var x = 1;
var y = "Hello World";
var a = "<h1>Hello World</h1>";
document.write(a);
```

### **or**
```javascript
var b, c, d, e;
b = "This is a variable";
c = "This is also a variable";
d = "And another one"
e = "Wow!"
console.log(e);
```

### **Other ways to describe a variable, although there is difference between the scopes of these variables**
```javascript
var = x;
let = x;
const = x;
```
